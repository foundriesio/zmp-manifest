This used to be a repo manifest repository. It is now a west manifest
repository. For more details on west:

It is no longer possible to manage the ZmP using Google repo. Older,
repo-based ZmP updates will continue to work, however. You can install
those using the documentation specific to an old update.

The last repo-based ZmP update was number 39. Documentation for that
is here:
